# Enhance Your Style with Rock'z Hair Studio's Hair Extension Procedure

At Rock'z Hair Studio, our hair extension procedure is designed to instantly add length, volume, and glamour to your natural hair, transforming your look with seamless precision.

## Consultation for Personalization

Your journey starts with a detailed consultation. Our stylists assess your natural hair and discuss your desired length, volume, and style. We help you choose from a variety of extension types, such as clip-ins, tape-ins, weaves, or keratin-bonded extensions, ensuring they perfectly match your hair color and texture.

## Preparing Your Hair

Before applying the extensions, we prepare your hair by gently cleansing and drying it. This step is crucial for ensuring that the extensions adhere properly and blend seamlessly.

## Application with Care

Depending on the chosen method, our skilled stylists meticulously apply the extensions. For tape-ins and keratin-bonded extensions, small sections of hair are carefully selected and the extensions are applied close to the roots. Weaves are sewn into braided hair. Clip-ins are placed strategically for a temporary yet transformative look.

## Styling and Blending

After the extensions are securely in place, our stylists cut and style them to blend flawlessly with your natural hair. Whether you desire soft waves, straight locks, or a custom cut, we ensure your new extensions complement your overall look.

## Maintenance Guidance

We provide expert advice on maintaining your extensions, including how to wash, dry, and style them, ensuring they remain beautiful and last as long as possible.

Rock'z Hair Studio's hair extension procedure is more than just adding length; it's about enhancing your natural beauty and giving you the confidence to flaunt your new, luxurious locks.
